# KiiToolkit - Android
### What is KiiToolkit?
A library of utilities for Android that is designed to make your app development simpler!

Includes not only utilities for developing on [Kii Cloud](http://developer.kii.com "Kii Cloud"), but also general utilities for nice UI elements and other convenient utilities that we find useful in app development.

### How do I use it?

### What is Kii Cloud?
[Kii Cloud](http://developer.kii.com "Kii Cloud") is a Mobile-Backend-as-a-Service (MBaaS) which provides client SDKs for you to build a cloud-connected application without ever building or maintaining any servers or databases. Kii Cloud scales with your app and provides a reliable backend, allowing you to get your app up and running in a fraction of the time.
